## My Neovim Configuration

This is my new (for 2024) configuration of neovim, the editor that makes it 
feel like you built it yourself.

At the moment it is in a very unstable state, as I am migrating my 
![old config](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/neovim-config-2023)
to the current version of neovim, the current version of 
![neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide), and to using 
![lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), the neovim package manager
that hopefully won't get deprecated like 
![packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) did.
